  <h2>Submission Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Teams wishing to participate in the challenge on 1 October 2012 should should submit a short paper describing their segmentation method, as well as the results obtained on the <a href="data.html">training data</a> <b>before 3 July 2012</b>. Teams accepted to the on-site challenge will be then notified by the organizers before 6 July 2012.

    <p>Each teams' paper should be formatted in the <a href="http://www.springer.com/computer+science/lncs?SGWID=0-164-6-793341-0">LNCS style</a>, and be at least 2-4 pages long. It should describe the method used, indicate whether or not human interaction is required, and include an estimate of the running time for a single patient (note that slow methods can also participate in the on-site challenge - see the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for details). In addition, the paper should also include a table summarizing the segmentation performance on the training data, obtained using the <a href="evaluation.html">online evaluation tool</a> provided by the organizers. Since the reference segmentations of the training cases are made publicly available, it is the authors' own responsibility to design a cross-validation experiment (i.e., to test their method on other cases than the ones used to tweak and tune algorithmic settings), and to describe their experiments and results accordingly. <b>The final ranking of the competing algorithms will be based only on their performance on the independent set of test scans that will be made available on-site!</b>
